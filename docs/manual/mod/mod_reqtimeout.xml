    <ol>
      <li>
        Allow 10 seconds to receive the request including the headers and
        30 seconds for receiving the request body:

        <example>
          RequestTimeout headerinit=10 bodyinit=30
        </example>
      </li>

      <li>
        Allow at least 10 seconds to receive the request including the headers.
        If the client sends data, increase the timeout by 1 second for every
        500 bytes received. But do not allow more than 30 seconds for the
        request including the headers:

        <example>
          RequestTimeout headerinit=10 headerminrate=500 headermax=30
        </example>
      </li>

      <li>
        Allow at least 10 seconds to receive the request body.
        If the client sends data, increase the timeout by 1 second for every
        1000 bytes received, with no upper limit for the timeout (exept for
        the limit given indirectly by
        <directive module="core">LimitRequestBody</directive>):

        <example>
          RequestTimeout bodyinit=10 bodyminrate=1000
        </example>

<syntax>RequestTimeout

</contextlist>

<usage>
    <p>This directive can set various timeouts for receiving the request headers
    and the request body from the client. If the client fails to send headers or
    body within the configured time, a <code>408 REQUEST TIME OUT</code> error
    is sent.</p>

    <p>For SSL virtual hosts, the header timeout values include the time needed
    to do the initial SSL handshake. The body timeout values include the time
    needed for SSL renegotiation (if necessary).</p>

    <p>When an <directive module="core">AcceptFilter</directive> is in use
    (usually the case on Linux and FreeBSD), the socket is not sent to the
    server process before at least one byte (or the whole request for
    <code>httpready</code>) is received. The header timeout configured with
    <code>RequestTimeout</code> is only effective after the server process has
    received the socket.</p>

    <p>For the timeout parameters, the value 0 means no limit.</p>

    <dl>

    <dt><code>headerinit</code></dt>
    <dd>The initial timeout for receiving the request headers in seconds. 
    Also the timeout for receiving the first byte of the request. If
    <code>headerminrate</code> is not set, the request line and all headers
    must be received within this time.</dd>

    <dt><code>headerminrate</code></dt>
    <dd>The minimum data rate for receiving the request headers in
    bytes/second. Whenever data is received, the timeout is increased
    according to this data rate.</dd>

    <dt><code>headermax</code></dt>
    <dd>The maximum timeout for receiving the request headers in seconds.
    The timeout cannot be increased above this value by
    <code>headerminrate</code>.</dd>

    <dt><code>bodyinit</code></dt>
    <dd>The initial timeout for receiving the request body in seconds. 
    Also the timeout for receiving the first byte of the request body. If
    <code>bodyminrate</code> is not set, the complete request body must be
    received within this time.</dd>

    <dt><code>bodyminrate</code></dt>
    <dd>The minimum data rate for receiving the request body in
    bytes/second. Whenever data is received, the timeout is increased
    according to this data rate.</dd>

    <dt><code>bodymax</code></dt>
    <dd>The maximum timeout for receiving the request body in seconds.
    The timeout cannot be increased above this value by
    <code>bodyminrate</code></dd>

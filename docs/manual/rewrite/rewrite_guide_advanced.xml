  <title>URL Rewriting Guide - Advanced topics</title>

  <summary>

    <p>This document supplements the <module>mod_rewrite</module>
    <a href="../mod/mod_rewrite.html">reference documentation</a>.
    It describes how one can use Apache's <module>mod_rewrite</module>
    to solve typical URL-based problems with which webmasters are
    commonly confronted. We give detailed descriptions on how to
    solve each problem by configuring URL rewriting rulesets.</p>

    <note type="warning">ATTENTION: Depending on your server configuration
    it may be necessary to adjust the examples for your
    situation, e.g., adding the <code>[PT]</code> flag if
    using <module>mod_alias</module> and
    <module>mod_userdir</module>, etc. Or rewriting a ruleset
    to work in <code>.htaccess</code> context instead
    of per-server context. Always try to understand what a
    particular ruleset really does before you use it; this
    avoids many problems.</note>

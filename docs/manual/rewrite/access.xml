<title>Using mod_rewrite to control access</title>

<summary>

<p>This document supplements the <module>mod_rewrite</module> 
<a href="../mod_rewrite.html">reference documentation</a>. It describes
how you can use <module>mod_rewrite</module> to control access to
various resources, and other related techniques.
This includes many examples of common uses of mod_rewrite,
including detailed descriptions of how each works.</p>

<p>Note that many of these examples won't work unchanged in your
particular server configuration, so it's important that you understand
them, rather than merely cutting and pasting the examples into your
configuration.</p>

<title>Using mod_rewrite for virtual hosting</title>

<summary>

<p>This document supplements the <module>mod_rewrite</module> 
<a href="../mod/mod_rewrite.html">reference documentation</a>. It describes
how you can use <module>mod_rewrite</module> to create dynamically 
configured virtual hosts.</p>

<note type="warning">mod_rewrite is not the best way to configure
virtual hosts. You should first consider the <a
href="../vhosts/mass.html">alternatives</a> before resorting to
mod_rewrite.</note>

  <title>Virtual Hosts Per User</title>

  <dl>
    <dt>Description:</dt>

    <dd>
    <p>We want to automatically create a virtual host for every user who
    has an account on our web server system, without having to create
    new VirtualHost sections.</p>

    <p>In this recipe, we assume that we'll be using the hostname
    <code>www.<strong>username</strong>.example.com</code> for each
    user, and serve their content out of
    <code>/home/<strong>username</strong>/www</code>.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Solution:</dt>

    <dd>

<example><pre>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond   %{<strong>HTTP_HOST</strong>}        ^www\.<strong>([^.]+)</strong>\.example\.com$
RewriteRule   ^(.*) /home/<strong>%1</strong>/www$1
</pre></example></dd>

<dt>Discussion</dt>
    <dd>

    <note type="warning">You will need to take care of the DNS 
    resolution - Apache does
    not handle name resolution. You'll need either to create CNAME 
    records for each hostname, or a DNS wildcard record. Creating DNS
    records is beyond the scope of this document.</note>

<p>Parentheses used in a <directive
module="mod_rewrite">RewriteCond</directive> are captured into the
backreferences <code>%1</code>, <code>%2</code>, etc, while parentheses
used in <directive module="mod_rewrite">RewriteRule</directive> are
captured into the backreferences <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>,
etc.</p>

<p>
As with many techniques discussed in this document, mod_rewrite really
isn't the best way to accomplish this task. You should, instead,
consider using <module>mod_vhost_alias</module> instead, as it will much
more gracefully handle anything beyond serving static files, such as any
dynamic content, and Alias resolution.

<title>When not to use mod_rewrite</title>

<summary>

<p>This document supplements the <module>mod_rewrite</module> 
<a href="../mod_rewrite.html">reference documentation</a>. It describes
perhaps one of the most important concepts about mod_rewrite - namely,
when to avoid using it.</p>

<p>mod_rewrite should be considered a last resort, when other
alternatives are found wanting. Using it when there are simpler
alternatives leads to configurations which are confusing, fragile, and
hard to maintain. Understanding what other alternatives are available is
a very important step towards mod_rewrite mastery.</p>

<p>Note that many of these examples won't work unchanged in your
particular server configuration, so it's important that you understand
them, rather than merely cutting and pasting the examples into your
configuration.</p>

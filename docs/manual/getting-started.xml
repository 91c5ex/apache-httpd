  <title>Getting Started</title>

<summary>
<p>If you're completely new to the Apache HTTP Server, or even to running
a website at all, you might not know where to start, or what questions to
ask. This document walks you through the basics.</p>
</summary>

<section id="clientserver">
<title>Clients, Servers, and URLs</title>

<p>
Addresses on the Web are expressed with URLs - Uniform Resource Locators
- which specify a protocol (e.g. <code>http</code>), a servername (e.g.
<code>www.apache.org</code>), a URL-path (e.g.
<code>/docs/current/getting-started.html</code>), and possibly a query
string (e.g. <code>?arg=value</code>) used to pass additional
arguments to the server. 
</p>

<p>A client (e.g., a web browser) connects to a server (e.g., your Apache HTTP Server), 
with the specified protocol, and makes a <strong>request</strong> for a resource using the
URL-path.</p>

<p>The URL-path may represent any number of things on the server. It may
be a file (like <code>getting-started.html</code>) a handler (like <a
href="mod/mod_status.html">server-status</a>) or some kind of program
file (like <code>index.php</code>). We'll discuss this more below in
the <a href="#content">Web Site Content</a> section.</p>

<p>
The server will send a <strong>response</strong> consisting of a status
code and, optionally, a response body.
The status code indicates whether the request was successful, and, if not, what
kind of error condition there was. This tells the client what it should
do with the response. You can read about the possible response codes in
<a href="http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/CommonHTTPStatusCodes">HTTP Server
wiki</a>.</p>

<p>Details of the transaction, and any error conditions, are written to
log files. This is discussed in greater detail below in the <a
href="#logs">Logs Files and Troubleshooting</a> section.</p>

</section>

<section id="dns">
<title>Hostnames and DNS</title>

<p>In order to connect to a server, the client will first have to resolve
the servername to an IP address - the location on the Internet where the
server resides. Thus, in order for your web server to be reachable, it
is necessary that the servername be in DNS.</p>

<p>If you don't know how to do this, you'll need to contact your network
administrator, or Internet service provider, to perform this step for
you.</p>

<p>If you are testing a server that is not Internet-accessible, you
can put host names in your hosts file in order to do local resolution.
For example, you might want to put a record in your hosts file to map a
request for <code>www.example.com</code> to your local system, for
testing purposes. This entry would look like:</p>

<example>
127.0.0.1 www.example.com
</example>

<p>A hosts file will probably be located at <code>/etc/hosts</code> or
<code>C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts</code>.</p>

<p>You can read more about the hosts file at <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)">Wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)</a>, and
more about DNS at <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">Wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System</a>.</p>

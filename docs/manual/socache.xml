  <title>Shared Object Cache in Apache HTTP Server</title>

  <summary>
    <p>The Shared Object Cache provides a means to share simple data
    across all a server's workers, regardless of <a href="mpm.html">thread
    and process models</a>.  It is used where the advantages of sharing
    data across processes outweigh the performance overhead of
    inter-process communication.</p>
  </summary>

  <section id="providers">
    <title>Shared Object Cache Providers</title>
    <p>The shared object cache as such is an abstraction.  Four different
    modules implement it.  To use the cache, one or more of these modules
    must be present, and configured.</p>
    <p>The only configuration required is to select which cache provider
    to use.  This is the responsibility of modules using the cache, and
    they enable selection using directives such as
    <directive module="authn_socache">AuthnCacheSOCache</directive>,
    <directive module="ssl">SSLSessionCache</directive>, and
    <directive module="ssl">SSLStaplingCache</directive>.</p>
    <p>Currently available providers are:</p>
    <dl>
    <dt>"dbm" (mod_socache_dbm)</dt>
    <dd>This makes use of a DBM hash file.
     The choice of underlying DBM used may be configurable
     if the installed APR version supports multiple DBM implementations.</dd>
    <dt>"dc" (mod_socache_dc)</dt>
    <dd>This makes use of the <a href="http://www.distcache.org/">distcache</a>
    distributed session caching libraries.</dd>
    <dt>"memcache" (mod_socache_memcache)</dt>
    <dd>This makes use of the <a href="http://memcached.org/">memcached</a>
    high-performance, distributed memory object caching system.</dd>
    <dt>"shmcb" (mod_socache_shmcb)</dt>
    <dd>This makes use of a high-performance cyclic buffer inside a
     shared memory segment.</dd>

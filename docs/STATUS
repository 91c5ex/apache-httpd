              ------------------------------

To Do List
=======================

- The 1.3 docs need to have links from each directive forward to the
  /docs/current/ version of that directive, or a note that it's not
  available in this century. See core.html for examples of how this
  might be done. This is a large undertaking, and involves a lot of
  grunt work, but will be greatly appreciated by the folks that make it
  to the wrong doc via Google. (Update: This is clearly going to take
  many months of effort, due to the volume of work and the mind-numbing
  tediousness.)

- Update the http://httpd.apache.org/docs-project/docsformat.html
  document to be useful. In particular:
    - Document the various macros that can be used in documents.
    - Document the translation process.
    - Generally update it to make it reflect the current reality of how
      we work.
    -  Improving the documentation of the documentations' build system
       itself (requirements, procedures)

- Continue to enhance the FAQ, which is in the wiki:
  http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/FAQ

- Security docs are unhelpful, and assume that the reader knows nothing.
  Need something a little more advanced, which either discusses
  application-level security, or links to something that does. I'm not
  even sure what to say needs done. Can we get someone to elaborate on
  what, exactly, needs written? Ivan Ristic has said maybe he would be
  willing to contribute.
  - More content and better organisation
  - mod_dav resources are owned by the httpd. Perhaps write up the
    two-httpd dav setup covered in Rich Bowen's DAV Apachecon
    presentation.

- Performance doc "drop-in replace" wikified by Igor from Sander's
  presentation: http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/PerformanceScalingUp
  as well as: http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/PerformanceScalingOut
  They both need review and updates to reflect the current state
  of the art.

- Windows platform docs are in desperate need of rewrites/updates for 2.x.
    - Bill Rowe is a good contact for tech questions.
    - "using apache" has been done, "compiling apache" is still open
    - hints on uninstalling apache (exit monitor, close directories,
      registry entries etc) (PR 10154)
    - FAQ: UTF-8 config and URL encoding for non-ascii characters.

- New Auth system
    - Much clean-up and enhancement of aaa howto (Can someone clarify
      exactly what needs cleaned up and enhanced?)
    - Independent note on how to upgrade to new auth system
    - Discussion of DBD auth, and, in particular, examples of how to set
      up auth using each of the supported databases.

- Expression syntax for <If>, Require expr, SetEnvIfExpr, CustomLog, ...
  Start is in expr.xml, igalic is working on this

- modules docs
    - the follwing modules added since 2.2 lack documentation
        - mod_serf
        - mod_watchdog
        - mod_heartbeat
        - mod_heartmonitor
        - mod_lbmethod_bybusyness
        - mod_lbmethod_byrequests
        - mod_lbmethod_bytraffic
        - mod_lbmethod_heartbeat
        - mod_socache_dbm
        - mod_socache_memcache
        - mod_socache_shmcb
        - mpm_simple
      the list may be incomplete
      maybe some of the modules will not be included in 2.4
    - mod_suexec: very little documentation

- mod_substitute and reverse proxies: Add example using mod_filter
  (see: http://marc.info/?l=apache-httpd-users&m=128830729603423&w=2)

- MPM documentation
     - explain what the following command line options do
       (perhaps in the developer/debugging docs):
        -D DEBUG
        -D ONE_PROCESS -- is this the same as -X, if not, should it be?
              one-process-mode == no threads, i.e. only one
              process handling the requests in a single loop?

- Identify which documents are grossly out of date, and fix.
     - platform/ebcdic.xml - needs major rework for 2.0
     - SSL docs need serious update and enhancement
        - compat docs are wrong
        - A basic how to has been started here:
            http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/SettingUpModSSL
            but it needs some work...
        - http://blag.esotericsystems.at/2011/01/answering-trivial-and-interesting-questions-with-openssl/
          looks like a good starting point for overhauling the FAQ, and
          has been placed at our disposal by the author.

- API documentation
    - Ben Laurie has written some hooks documentation
    - authn provider API documentation could be useful

- How does <Proxy> fit into sections.html?

- Missing documentation for the support program checkgid

- New user docs: Directory Handling (mod_dir/mod_autoindex/etc)
  (draft available in wiki)

- Enhancements to the DTD/XSL:
  - New index: directives by context, including listing which directives
    are available for each AllowOverride setting.
  - New index: backout modules by type (aaa, mappers, loggers etc.)
    probably by introducing a <category> element in modulesynopsis
  - Use a tag like <var> in place of <em> for things like the
    <syntax> listing.
    - in progress
  - add letter links to glossary and quickreference,
    perhaps also a term overview (sidebar)

- Provide example solutions for the mapping of encodings, especially
  for .gz etc. (also in regard to our default configuration)

- How-To style documents for more of the daily tasks
    - Logging, log rotation, and log reporting
    - Secure mod_dav configuration

- Writing modules - Can we provide a basic intro to writing modules,
  perhaps based around mod_example, or one of the other simple example
  modules?

- http://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/developer/ is a graveyard, and a
  profound embarrassment.
    - Purge all the dead links
    - Introductory module authoring doc
    - Verify links to external resources at least every year

- Update the list of translations at
  http://httpd.apache.org/docs-project/translations.html  Some of those
  are accurate, and others are way outdated.

- I'd like to expand the discussion of conditional logging, and add a
  few more useful exmaples.
  That would be a good place to document logging of cache hit/miss:
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48241#c2

- Is it worth having a doc that discusses recommended (what does this
  mean?) third-party modules like mod_security, mod_php, and so on - the
  things that we all assume everyone uses, but some folks might not know
  about.

- Clarify which directives only affect requests when they're handled
  by the default handler.  (e.g. ForceType, TraceEnable, etc.)

- Order directives alphabetically. Some modules, particularly in
  translations, have directives in random order, rather than
  alphabetically.

- Run review_translations.pl on each of the files in the mod directory,
  and determine which directives are missing from the translation docs.
  Add them. This makes them show up in the directives listing for that
  language, and also encourages translators to provide translations for
  those directives.

- Add examples using expr to mod_rewrite recipes. Possibly benchmark the
  different approaches and make intelligent remarks about the
  comparative value of each.

LaTeX Todo list
==================

- Dozens of other little problems with presentation, cross-referencing,
  etc.

- Cleanup xsl to make it more readable.  Almost everything
  that is currently in latex.xsl should probably be moved to common.xsl.
  There may be a license problem with the atbeginend.sty file, since
  latex style files rarely have explict licenses.  At worst, we can
  drop this and manually adjust the relevant spacing.

- Reduce the size of the pdf (both bytes and pages) in any way possible.

- Translations.

Changes with Apache 2.5.0

  *) mod_proxy: Ensure we don't attempt to amend a table we are iterating
     through, ensuring that all headers listed by Connection are removed.

     the cache MUST disregard the response and repeat the request without the
     conditional. [Graham Leggett, Co-Advisor <coad measurement-factory.com>]

  *) mod_proxy: Fix seg-faults when using the global pool on threaded
     MPMs [Thomas Eckert <thomas.r.w.eckert gmail.com>, Jim Jagielski]

  *) mod_proxy: Ensure network errors detected by the proxy are returned as
     504 Gateway Timout as opposed to 502 Bad Gateway, in order to be
     compliant with RFC2616 14.9.4 Cache Revalidation and Reload Controls.
     [Graham Leggett, Co-Advisor <coad measurement-factory.com>]

     Not Modified response are caught and cause the entity to be removed.
     [Graham Leggett]

     multivalued headers referred to via Vary. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_cache: When serving from cache, only the last header of a multivalued
     header was taken into account. Fixed. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_cache: Ignore response headers specified by no-cache=header and
     private=header as specified by RFC2616 14.9.1 What is Cacheable. Ensure

     we compare unencoded paths. PR 53910 [Timothy Wood <tjw omnigroup.com>]

     full advantage of the event MPM. Enable the ability for a module
